# Overview 

This folder contains all the bounties that have been hosted by the https://huntr.dev platform.  

Vulnerabilities are stored within folders with the following format:
`/bounties/{RegistryName}/{PackageName}/{PackageVulnerabilityID}`

- RegistryName is the commonly used name for the main registry the package resides on
- PackageName is the name used to describe the package on the registry they are hosted on
- PackageVulnerabilityID is a numerical incrementing ID that is unique to the specific package (not universally unique)

# Files

A valid bounty is split between 3 files: 

## README.md

This is the description of the bounty that appears on a given bounty page. It's rendered with a simple markdown preprocessor with basic styling. This file is created by a huntr as part of their disclosure.
