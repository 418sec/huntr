## ‚úçÔ∏è Description
Apache MXNet is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility. It allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity. At its core, MXNet contains a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. MXNet is portable and lightweight, scalable to many GPUs and machines.
This package is vulnerable to MITM or Man-In-The-Middle attack due to a downloading resources through insecure protocols. It is possible for an attacker to intercept and alter the packages which may leads to RCE / other attacks which may help the attacker gain access to host.
