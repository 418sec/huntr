# Description
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.This package is vulnerable to ```MITM``` or ```Man-In-The-Middle``` attack due to a downloading resources through insecure protocols. It is possible for an attacker to intercept and alter the packages which may leads to RCE / other attacks which may help the attacker gain access to host.
