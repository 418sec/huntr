# Description
The ```TensorFlow Model Garden``` is a repository with a number of different implementations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and modeling solutions for ```TensorFlow``` users. We aim to demonstrate the best practices for modeling so that TensorFlow users can take full advantage of TensorFlow for their research and product development.
This package is vulnerable to ```MITM``` or ```Man-In-The-Middle``` attack due to a downloading resources through insecure protocols. It is possible for an attacker to intercept and alter the packages which may leads to RCE / other attacks which may help the attacker gain access to host.
