# Overview

colorscore finds the dominant colors in an image and scores them against a user-defined palette.

The contents of the `image_path`, `colors`, and `depth` variables generated from possibly user-supplied input are passed directly to the shell via `convert...`.

If a user supplies a value that includes shell metacharacters such as `;`, an attacker may be able to execute shell commands on the remote system as the user id of the Ruby process.

To resolve this issue, the aforementioned variables (especially `image_path`) must be sanitized for shell metacharacters.

```module Colorscore
    class Histogram
      def initialize(image_path, colors=16, depth=8)
        output = `convert #{image_path} -resize 400x400 -format %c -dither
None -quantize YIQ -colors #{colors} -depth #{depth} histogram:info:-`
        @lines = output.lines.sort.reverse.map(&:strip).reject(&:empty?)
      end
```
