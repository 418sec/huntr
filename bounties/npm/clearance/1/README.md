# Overview

clearance is an authentication app for rails.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attack. When attempting to authenticate a user, but no user was found with the provided email address, it skips calls to `BCrypt`. This allows attackers to time the response from the app to see if the provided user has an account, and help when attempting to guess a users password.
