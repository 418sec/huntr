# Overview

jquery-form is a jQuery plugin that allows you to upgrade HTML forms to use AJAX.

This package is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). This package does not sanitise AJAX responses before rendering them, therefore an attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML code into the page.
