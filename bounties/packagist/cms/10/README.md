# Description
during my hunt for XSS, I have accidentally dropped an xss payload which was accidentally shown on the index page leading to a persistent xss triggered entirely from a different account. It's a kind of account takeover vulnerability but as we are already admin it doesn't mean anything to us, so this can be considered as a persistent XSS at the index page of lavalite.
