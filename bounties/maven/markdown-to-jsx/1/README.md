# Overview

`org.webjars.npm:markdown-to-jsx` is a lightweight, customizable React markdown component.

This package is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). It is possible to circumvent sanitisation and inject script and style tags by using upper case letters, for example: `<SCRIPT>alert('hi')</SCRIPT>`.
