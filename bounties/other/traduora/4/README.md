## ‚úçÔ∏è Description
Encountered Session Fixation bug in traduora repo which can be chained along with my older submission on Massive account creation.
## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Proof of Concept 
* clone the github repo 
* setted up traduora platform to reproduce the vulnerability
* open an account in multiple browsers like 2 different private modes of chrome and firefox.
* login the same account in both browsers.
* change the password of the account in one browser, meanwhile, try to reload the same account in the other browser.
* we can see the old session still works and that there is no new session created for the change of password.
## üí• Impact
An attacker is able to maintain access with old sessions even if the security of the account is updated i had already submitted massive account creation bug so chaining with massive account creation makes this bug more critical
