And we are back with huntr highlights, this time with a bunch of new features coming to huntr.dev!
huntr highlights 
As always, here are a few of the top fixes we received this month:


Boxbilling is an open source billing and client management software that has been used & integrated with hundreds of worldwide systems including Paypal. A cross-site scripting vulnerability was identified in the package and was fixed by Mik317. Check out his fix here to learn how he did it!


Vizion is a Git/Subversion/Mercurial repository metadata parser which is downloaded almost 400,000 times every week. It was vulnerable to command injection until RadioAndrei fixed it by checking the revision string against a regex, making sure it only contains letters and digits. Check out the fix here.
Updates
New bounty board
We have given the bounty board a new paint job, making it easier for you to pick your bounties. You can now filter by language, and set your priorities, so you are shown the bounties that suit you best - check it out here.
New profile page
You now have a personal profile page that you can develop throughout your open source journey. Keep track of your disclosures, fixes and reviews, collect badges, and share your successes with your friends! 
Podcast: Bug huntr
There are three new episodes of Bug huntr out, Jimony speaks with a bunch of huntr users as well as Jamie Slome (or DUCKL1N6) who is huntrs' tech lead. Check it out on the huntr blog to find out what's coming in the next few weeks. 🔥
Competition winners
We held a few competitions this month, to be entered all we asked was for you to either get set up and fork the huntr-repo, or create a huntr meme. Without further ado, the winners of the contest are Hacktivist and d3mon-r00t - congratulations! we will be sending you some huntr swag shortly.
