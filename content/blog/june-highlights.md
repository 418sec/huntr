As the world starts to open up, we are still pushing along with our mission - to make it easy to contribute to open source, whilst empowering developers to think about security! 
huntr highlights 
It's become a tradition here at huntr to shout out some of the most impressive disclosures and fixes we have received over the month:


PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without the downtime, and to facilitate common system admin tasks. It is downloaded over 390,000 times per week and was vulnerable to Command Injection. toufik-airane wrote a patch which has now been accepted by the original repo!


electron-builder is a complete solution to package and build an Electron, Proton Native app for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It is downloaded over 90,000 times every week and is depended upon by over 32,000 other repositories. It was vulnerable to Signature Validation Bypass and has now been fixed by the community. Check out the GitHub Issue to read through Mik317's findings and the process he went through to fix it.
Updates
Review process
We have automated a lot of the review process, and expanded our dedicated team of sheriffs, meaning reviews are now being done throughout the week! With a few additional 'rules':
There will be a 24-hour buffer on all bounties once the first review is complete.If multiple fixes are received we will choose the winner based on the following criteria: 
         1. Accepted by repo
         2. Most robust fix
         3. Quickest fix


Thank you all for your feedback about our review process. We listened, we heard, and we hope this is the improvement you wanted to see - get in touch if you have any more suggestions.
